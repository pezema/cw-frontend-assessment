# Cogniware front end assesment

Please read the entire document carefully before you start writing code. If anything is not clear, please do not hesitate to ask. 

## Summary

The most common use of Angular Frontends is using CRUD APIs to save and view data. We want you to create a Angular application to view a list of records, add records and edit records.

## Assignment

We want you to create a Angular application that covers following areas

### Grocery list
Show following information in the list: name, quantity, unit. Clicking on the name should open the form to edit the details. 
Show the list in a "card" format rather than a simple list. (CardView should be a custom component with input parameters).

### Form to add item to the list
Show following input in the form name, quantity, unit. Name accepts any text, quantity accepts numbers only, unit is select box with values from API (List All Units). Add form validation - all three forms are required. 
Display response message in the application


### Form to edit item on the list
You may use the same form as for Add item. 
Display response message in the application

You may use any CSS like Angular Material, bootstrap, etc. to make the pages look nice

Note : You DO NOT need to create any API. The API is already created. The details are available here - https://cwfrontendassessmentapi.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/ 

(If you are not familiar with Apiary - click on Switch To Console button -> Select **Mock Server** from select box next to the Call Response button. API URL will show up on the top)

## Deliverable
Create a repository in your github account and commit the code into that repository. Send us the link to the repository. 
Note: You can also create git repository at the start and commit reguluary as you develop this application.
